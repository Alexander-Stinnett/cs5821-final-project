Engineers dance with the physical world, which means their ideas eventually turn into objects that can break, crush, spark, or explode if handled without care. Safety isn’t an afterthought; it’s baked into the design process so that a system behaves predictably even when a tired human, a worn-out part, or a freak environmental condition shows up. One common safeguard is the interlock, a mechanism that prevents a machine from operating unless certain conditions are met—doors fully closed, pressure normalized, voltages safe. Interlocks quietly enforce logic the way a compiler enforces type checking: a barrier against chaos.
