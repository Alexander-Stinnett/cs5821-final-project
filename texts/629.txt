Nature provides a soothing experience for our minds because it allows us the opportunity to unwind and simply breathe. Even just walking in a park for a few minutes can help reduce stress and feel more calm. Natural settings with colors, sounds, and fresh air often help us feel like processing mental clutter. Being in green spaces helps boost mood by reducing anxiety and improving attention. In general, nature reminds us to step away from distractions and build connections with ourselves.
