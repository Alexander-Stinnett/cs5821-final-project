The North American Blue Jay is a striking songbird known for its bright blue plumage, bold crest, and distinctive black-and-white markings. Found commonly in forests, parks, and suburban areas, it’s highly adaptable and intelligent. Blue Jays are excellent mimics, often imitating hawk calls to protect themselves or deceive other birds. They are also known for caching food—especially acorns—which even helps with forest regeneration.
