Volcanoes form when molten rock, gas, and pressure build up beneath the Earth’s surface. When they erupt, they can release lava, ash clouds, and powerful shockwaves that reshape entire landscapes. Some volcanoes erupt explosively, while others produce slow, steady flows of lava. Volcanic soil is extremely fertile, which is why many communities live near active volcanoes despite the risks. Scientists monitor seismic activity and gas emissions to predict eruptions and keep people safe.
