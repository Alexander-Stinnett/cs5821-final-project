Safety is a very important topic in the field of engineering. All kinds of engineers (mechanical, civil, computer, electrical, chemical, etc.) must be conscious of their own safety. Many industrial environments contain hazards that can cause serious injury or even death. Emergency stop buttons, often called E-Stops, are used to shut down hazardous equipment instantly to protect engineers.
