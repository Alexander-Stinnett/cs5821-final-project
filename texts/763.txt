I consider Annihilation, by Jeff VanderMeer, to be my favorite novel. Despite finishing it in an evening, it lingered in my mind long after I read the last page—taking root like the wild and overgrown vegetation of its setting. While I consider its prose and narrative quite strong, I think it's the thematic elements which have really stuck with me. VanderMeer uses the story of a doomed government expedition into an exclusion zone to explore one woman's life as an outsider and her search for answers, both in the immediate and the philosophical sense. Like her, the audience is forced to accept a certain lack of catharsis, to find answers only in the literal sense and to embrace the inherent uncertainty of existence.
