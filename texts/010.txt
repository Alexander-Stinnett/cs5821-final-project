Well, shoot — lemme tell ya 'bout the time my cousin Earl tried teachin' his pet raccoon to drive the tractor. He hopped up on the seat, slapped on a pair o' sunglasses, and weaved through the corn like it owed him money while Aunt Mabel hollered 'bout the pie bakin' in the oven. Cops showed up, raccoon tipped his hat, and Earl swore it was all a misunderstanding 'til the raccoon filed for the insurance claim.
