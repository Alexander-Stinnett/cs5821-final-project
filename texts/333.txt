Some of the best activities in Houghton are outdoors, such as going to see waterfalls like Douglass Houghton Falls and Hungarian Falls and any recreational activity, like hiking, biking, canoeing, and boating. The winter cold and snow doesn't stop the fun with activities like cross country skiing, downhill skiing, snowshoeing, and snowboarding. Students at nearby Michigan Tech also host many fun winter events, including broomball matches and winter carnival snow sculpture building.
