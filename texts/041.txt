Of all the things that Michigan's Upper Peninsula is known for, one thing stands out among the rest. Harsh winters are a well-known fact of life, with high winds and strong lake effect snow, particularly in the Keweenaw Peninsula. The isolated landscape is strangely peaceful when the snow has fallen, trapping sound and slowing everything down. The world moves on, and the hardy people adapt to the change, simply living on in the winter wonderland.
