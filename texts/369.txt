The 2025 fall semester is now about to fall out. Students are getting ready for the break starting this Friday of November 21st, which is going to run until the 30th of November. Most of them are going back home to celebrate thanksgiving with their families, eat pleasant food, sharing with others and creating memories like every other year's thanksgiving. After the break, all students are going to write their final exams for the fall semester, submit their projects then go for the holidays until spring 2026.
