Winters in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula are long, intense, and genuinely defining. Lake-effect snow can pile up in staggering amounts, turning towns like Houghton and Calumet into snow-covered corridors for months at a time. The cold settles in early and lingers well into spring, but the community adapts—snowblowers hum, plows never rest, and people carry on with a kind of cheerful resilience. It’s harsh, yes, but also strangely beautiful, with quiet forests, frozen waterfalls, and nights lit by the aurora.
